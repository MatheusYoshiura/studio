## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#71D6D5) to give a clean, accessible, efficient impression. The tone of blue suggests reliability, calm, and trustworthiness without being too corporate.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#23262b). The extremely low saturation matches the primary color in hue. This color also provides a clear, sharp contrast for content in a dark color scheme, creating focus.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) to add a vibrant, friendly visual spark to important user interface elements. This is brighter and more saturated than the primary.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif font. Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif.
- Use a set of modern, minimalist icons to represent different task categories and actions, ensuring they are easily recognizable and visually consistent.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy, ensuring key functionalities are easily accessible and the user interface is uncluttered.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, providing feedback on interactions and guiding users through the application.
